# Las Palmas Agency

<span class="image main"><img src="/images/freelancer/header.jpg" alt="Adriaan van Rossum also has an agency" /></span>

One way to define agency is the abstract principle that autonomous beings, agents, are capable of acting by themselves. The agents of the Las Palmas Agency are very autonomous, which means we are able to solve complex puzzels without needing any programming knowledge from our customers. You just explain the challenge you experiance in your business and we can build the tools you will need.

We as an agency love to code and we are really capable of thinking with or for you. That is one reason why we don't do simple informational websites like WordPress. We are all university educated what makes us capable of building complex tools from the ground up. We are also not scared of touching some hardware to fight your challenges.

Just **contact us** via the form on the bottom of this page or via the links you will see there.
