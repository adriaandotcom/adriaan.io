# [Wat is er op de radio](http://watiseropderadio.nl)

<span class="image main"><img src="/images/watiseropderadio/header.jpg" alt="Adriaan van Rossum's radio website" /></span>

The oldest project I've build is [watiseropderadio.nl](http://watiseropderadio.nl). It contains a playlist with all songs played on the biggest Dutch radio stations. Monthly, the website attracts over **40.000 visits** and has **150.000 pageviews**. I built a web crawler which crawls a lot of websites from the radio stations and pulls the current track out of their HTML-page. Recently the website also gives the visitors the opportunity to listen to **radio-fragments** of the last 10 days.

This website is build in the good old PHP days. There is a lot of airplay data because the website is online for years. We all know [this is over](https://evertpot.com/PHP-Sucks/), but rewriting the whole website takes a lot of time. You have to choose the best projects for the limited time available so I decided to keep this project for what it is.
