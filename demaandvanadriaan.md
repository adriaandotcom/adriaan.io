# [Blog (De maand van Adriaan)](https://demaandvanadriaan.nl)

<span class="image main"><img src="/images/demaandvanadriaan/header.jpg" alt="Adriaan van Rossum's blog" /></span>

This blog is unfortunately in Dutch, so if you don't speak that language you rather not go there. It is a blog about some experiments of a month I do once in a while. For example being **vegan** for a month, give 5 complements a day or **drink no coffee** at all. The goal of this blog is to experiment with my own life and to see what happens while not doing this I usualy do.

It is called "the month of Adriaan" **in Dutch**, which -not surprisingly- indicates the duration of each experiment. Some people like the blog, some people don't, [see it](https://demaandvanadriaan.nl) for yourself.
