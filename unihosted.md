UniHosted is a SaaS that hosts UniFi Controllers in the cloud. Normally, IT service providers would install these controller themselves, but with UniHosted it's only a few clicks.

This product I created together with Iron Brands and Dries Steenberghe. Iron and I could re-use our experience from [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com) in this new product. Dries had done the research and development for the infrastructure, which makes us a perfect team.
