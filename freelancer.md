# Freelancer

<span class="image main"><img src="/images/freelancer/header.jpg" alt="Adriaan van Rossum also does some freelance work" /></span>

I love to code and to make my world a little broader then always working in the same "safe" environment. That is one of the reasons why I do some freelancing on the side. Just **contact me** via the form on the bottom of this page or via the links you will see there. Here are some things I love:

 * **JavaScript** frameworks<br>(expert in [Ember](http://emberjs.com), familiar with [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/))
 * Good knowledge about what you can do with CSS and HTML<br>
   (I love to use as much as **native** browser features as possible)
 * Able to build (deploy) scripts in bash or whatever is best

You can browse this website ([here](/member-get-member-company.html) or [here](/watiseropderadio.html)) to get an idea of what you can expect from me.
